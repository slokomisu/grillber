# Grillber
**The Idea**: Yep, you guessed it. Uber for grills. If you live in a city, you may not have the space for a grill or a safe place to lock it up. For example, if you live on the 20th floor of an apartment building, where can you put your grill?

Problem solved with GrillBer, a delivery service for grill rentals. This will allow customers to put on a cookout with none of the logistics. In fact, you might want to include a roll of turf and chairs so your customers can create a [pop-up park](http://inhabitat.com/parking-day-2014-the-most-amazing-pop-up-parks-from-san-francisco-and-beyond/) in a parking space!

**Type of Site**: Delivery/Logistics

**Key Functions:**

* Form that allows a user to book a grill for a certain number of hours at a certain hourly rate, and stores that in a database. User must input their name, address etc.

* Calendar that shows different times that grills are available. Check out Zipcar for an example of this.

* Product details page that shows the grill and tells you more about the different add-ons, like chairs and turf.

* Social media integration with Instagram that shows all the awesome cookouts people have held with GrillBer.

* A checkout process and payments system with Stripe so users can complete the process.

**Key Feature Decisions:**

* This does not need to be visually stimulating like Uber. But does it even need a cool interactive calendar? Or can you get away with a basic form like an e-commerce site?

* How many pains in the grilling process will you offer to address? Do you expect the user to clean the grill? Are these the cheaper but slower charcoal grills, or more expensive gas grills?

* Cookouts are meant to be a low-stress experience. If people have to hurry to cook their food, it will not be a great experience. How can you use copy and microcopy to clearly state how this will not be a stressful process?

* What logic do you need to have on your back-end for the booking system? Do you need to allow a half-hour before and after for grill delivery?


**What You Will Learn:** How to coordinate the front-end and back-end of a booking system. Think about how many sites do this. Restaurant booking sites. Conference room booking sites. There are many more. This is a very common pattern, and a great accomplishment to have on your resume for discussion.
